My name is François Beausoleil, and I live in Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada.  I was born in 1973, and that makes me more than 30 years old !

I started coding in the early 80s on an "Adam":http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=57, from Colecovision.  I then upgraded to the "Commodore 64":http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=98, diverted through the "Amiga 2000HD":http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=63 (with a 40 Mb HD, no less !), and then I started my way onto PCs.

In early 2005, I made the plunge, and started my own company:  "International Technological Solutions":http://www.teksol.info/.  Since then, I have worked numerous hours, for little pay, but isn't it interesting !

Lately, I jumped on the "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com bandwagon, from "Java":http://java.sun.com/.

If I'm on the #rubyonrails IRC, you'll find me as fbos.  If you want to send an E-Mail, feel free to use "francois@teksol.info":francois@teksol.info.
