<div class="obsolete">Trevor blogged "Time Bomb Test":http://almosteffortless.com/2009/04/05/time-bomb-test/ in 2009, which made this article obsolete.  Then, the day after, Jeremy McAnally wrote "Deprecate":http://github.com/jeremymcanally/deprecate, a gem to automate some versions of time bombing your tests.</div>

Sometimes, I have an idea for a test, but I am testing something else and I don't want to break my thought flow.

In those cases, I will write myself a time bomb:

<% code do -%>def test_has_more_entries_after_update
  flunk if Time.now > Time.local(2005, 12, 9, 10, 0, 0)
end
<% end -%>

This test will pass, until Dec 9 2005, 10 AM.  Nice way to not forget to add some tests.
