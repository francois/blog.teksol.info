Sometimes, I have an idea for a test, but I am testing something else and I don't want to break my thought flow.

In those cases, I will write myself a time bomb:
<% code do -%>def test_has_more_entries_after_update
  flunk if Time.now > Time.local(2005, 12, 9, 10, 0, 0)
end
<% end -%>

This test will pass, until Dec 9 2005, 10 AM.  Nice way to not forget to add some tests.
