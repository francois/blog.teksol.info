<div class="obsolete">This article is obsolete.  You may find it's replacement at "Actions With Dashes - updated":http://blog.teksol.info/2009/04/02/actions-with-dashes-updated</div>

Want to get an action with a dash in it's name and still do something useful ?  Try this:

<% code do -%>class WelcomeController < ApplicationController
  define_method("sign-up".to_sym) do
    if request.post? then
      # Do something
    end
  end
end
<% end -%>

Of course, if you don't have anything to do, just name the view file appropriately: <var>app/views/welcome/sign-up.rhtml</var>.
