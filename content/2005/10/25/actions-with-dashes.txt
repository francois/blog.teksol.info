Want to get an action with a dash in it's name and still do something useful ?  Try this:

<% code do -%>class WelcomeController < ApplicationController
  define_method("sign-up".to_sym) do
    if request.post? then
      # Do something
    end
  end
end
<% end -%>

Of course, if you don't have anything to do, just name the view file appropriately: <var>app/views/welcome/sign-up.rhtml</var>.
