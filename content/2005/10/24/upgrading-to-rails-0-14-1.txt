After updating my externals to Rails 0.14.1, I ran into a few snags.  First one is a difference in the handling of boolean attributes between both versions.  I had the following assertion:

<% code do -%>class EstimateTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_converts_base_information_to_quote
    # ...
    assert_equal e.pst_active, q.pst_active, 'copied pst active'
  end
end
<% end -%>

<var>q</var> is an instance of <var>Quote</var>, and <var>e</var> is an instance of <var>Estimate</var>.  In both cases, <var>pst_active</var> determines if the provincial tax is active.  It is a boolean attribute, but I had forgotten to use the <var>attr_name?</var> form.  In 0.13.1, this worked, but with 0.14.1, it failed with the following:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>  1) Failure:
test_converts_base_information_to_quote(EstimateTest) [./test/unit/estimate_test.rb:493]:
copied pst active.
<1> expected but was
<true>.
<% end -%>

When I switched both calls to <var>pst_active</var> to the boolean form, the assertion passed again.

Next, I had *44* failures in my functionnal tests:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%> 44) Error:
test_destroyed_pictures_dont_appear_in_the_slideshow(WelcomeControllerTest):
TypeError: cannot convert Symbol into String
    D:/rails-app/config/../lib/productize.rb:38:in `+'
    D:/rails-app/config/../lib/productize.rb:38:in `full_template_path'
<% end -%>

This application makes use of the "Rails Product Generator":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsProductGenerator.  Notice the bug is in <code>lib/productize.rb</code>, and not my code per se.  Line 38 of <var>lib/productize.rb</var> looks like this:

<% code do -%>site_specific_path = File.join(SITE_ROOT, 'app', 'views', template_path + '.' + extension)
<% end -%>

I corrected the error by simply calling <var>to_s</var> on both <var>template_path</var> and <var>extension</var>.

After that, my tests ran perfectly !  Shows how important it is to have even a minimal test suite.
