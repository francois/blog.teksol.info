I have the following CRON entries for one of my sites:
<% code(:lang => "cron") do -%>39 * * * * killall -9 dispatch.fcgi >/dev/null 2>&1
0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52,56 * * * * \
curl http://www.weputlightsup.com/ >/dev/null 2>&1
<% end -%>

What does this do ?  The first entry kills all of my FastCGI processes at 39 minutes past the hour.  The second one pings a specific URL to ensure the FastCGI processes are always up and running, every four minutes.

I am certainly not the first to mention this technique, see "View processes, grep out by user and then kill all their PIDs (TextDrive support)":http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/8.

Seems strange though that I couldn't find much references to this technique while "Googling":http://www.google.com/search?q=restart+fastcgi+process+cron around.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone.
