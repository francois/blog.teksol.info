Is it me or do most Rails applications need the "Rails Product Generator":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsProductGenerator  ?

For instance, I am building an application that has two faces - frontend and backend.  The backend has the administrative interfaces, and the frontend can only play around with the data - not change it.

In a previous application, I made an Admin module, but for security purposes, this time I don't want that - it cuts off a whole section of my webspace, which I don't want to do.

So, what do other people do ?
