I just uploaded a new version of the HABTM Helper Plugin.  No new features, except it now works...

There was a bug which would cause an error when the selected elements were not updated by the end-user.  All the IDs were bunched together, instead of being separated by commas.

This is an artifact of the fact that the view helper was not built using "behavioral driven development":http://blog.teksol.info/articles/2005/11/17/building-a-plugin-on-rspec.

Anyway, it now all works, and is in production on two projects of mine.

Hope it helps someone !
