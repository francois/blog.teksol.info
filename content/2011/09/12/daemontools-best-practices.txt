I sometimes have to do sysadmin work, such as when I'm the sole technical person on a probject. When I need to keep a service running, I usually turn to "daemontools":http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html. Daemontools was written by "D. J. Bernstein":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein, a mathematician and author of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/unix.html">many UNIX utilities</a>.

From daemontools' home page:

<blockquote>
<p>daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.</p>
<p class="signature"><a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools home page</a></p>
</blockquote>

What this means is daemontools is designed to run, and keep running, a service. Daemontools also includes other utilities which I find useful, such as <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/setuidgid.html">setuidgid</a>, <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envdir.html">envdir</a> and <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html">multilog</a>,. I searched for an article such as this, but couldn't find it. If you find a factual error, please let me know immediately. If you have your own best practices, let me know so I can expand on the list.
