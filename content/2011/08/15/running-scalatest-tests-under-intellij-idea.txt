I had lots of difficulties running my tests under IDEA. The exact error message was:

<blockquote><p>Error running All Tests:<br/>Not found suite class.</p></blockquote>

Where <q>All Tests</q> was the name of my Run configuration.

I finally ended up with the right incantations. In my "POM":http://maven.apache.org/pom.html, I have the following:

<% code(:lang => :xml) do %><dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.8.1</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.scalatest</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalatest_2.9.0-1</artifactId>
      <version>1.6.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
      <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.8.1</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
<% end %>

Then, I had to extend <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code> for my test classes, like this:

<% code(:lang => "scala") do %>import org.scalatest.Suite
import org.junit.Test

class GivenAnEmptyQueue extends Suite {
  @Test def thenItShouldNotHaveAnyElements() {
    assert(new Queue.empty)
  }
}
<% end %>

Finally, I had to verify that both the JUnit and Scala plugins were enabled and at their latest versions in the IDE itself. After that, I was able to run my tests from within the IDE.
