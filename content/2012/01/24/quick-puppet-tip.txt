While testing my "Puppet":http://puppetlabs.com/ recipes, I usually boot a new instance then apply configuration manually. I have a base configuration, which is extended with other things. I just noticed I could apply a manifest using STDIN:

<% code do %># ( echo "include sysbase" ; echo "include rabbitmq" ) | puppet apply -v
<% end %>

Viva the Unix tradition!

If you do any kind of configuration management, I highly recommend Puppet.
