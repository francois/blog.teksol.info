Today sees a new release of "Cliaws":http://github.com/francois/cliaws/wikis.  This is a simple library to interact with "S3":http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&node=16427261&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA (and other services) through the command-line.  This library is very similar to Amazon's own ec2-* scripts, except this library is written in "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org/.

Interacting with S3 should be no harder than:

<typo:code lang="shell">$ clis3 put my-local-file my-bucket/my-s3-file
</typo:code>

Put many files at once:
<typo:code lang="shell">$ clis3 put my-local-file0 my-local-file1 my-bucket/my-s3-directory/
</typo:code>

Put an environment variable:
<typo:code lang="shell">$ clis3 put --data $MY_DATA my-bucket/my-env-value
</typo:code>

Put stdin too!
<typo:code lang="shell">$ tar czfv /var/cache/mylvmbackup/backup | clis3 put - my-bucket/my-backup/backup-20080825-000000.tar.gz
</typo:code>

All of this functionnality is available from with Ruby too:

<textarea name="code" class="ruby" rows="12">require "rubygems"
require "cliaws"

Cliaws.s3.put("this is the content", "my-bucket/my-s3-file")
File.open("my-local-file", "rb") do |io|
  Cliaws.s3.put(io, "my-bucket/my-s3-file")
end
</textarea>

Give the "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/ gem servers a couple of hours to refresh themselves, and then enjoy!
