Well, the first day is over.  The talks were very interesting, especially Obie's.  Obie talked about how we should market ourselves / our company, and how to close deals.  All of this essentially relates to a power balance between the lead / customer and us.

I was very impressed with the organization of the conference.  One problem I had is the hackfest.  We were in an art gallery, which is a very interesting place to be.  Unfortunately, we didn't have enough power outlets for everyone.  And the place that was offered for hacking was in a cinema room.  "Kill Bill, Vol. 1" was playing, which is interesting, but it distracted us.  Then the space was pretty minimal to hold the laptop.

Anyways, I'm enjoying myself very much.  I was supposed to work on Piston, which I have barely started on right now.  That's what I'm going to do next.
