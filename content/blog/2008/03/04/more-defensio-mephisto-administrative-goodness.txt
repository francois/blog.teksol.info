Why should you switch to "Defensio":http://defensio.com/ instead of "Akismet":http://akismet.com/ ?  Because of this:

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://blog.teksol.info/assets/2008/3/4/mephisto-defensio-spaminess.png"><img src="http://blog.teksol.info/assets/2008/3/4/mephisto-defensio-spaminess.png" width="360" alt="The Mephisto interface, when interfaced with Defensio shows the spaminess of each comment, as well as use different shades of orange to show spammy comments"/></a><br/>

Defensio provides useful statistics to the blogger.  A typical response would look like:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="15" class="yaml">---
defensio-result: 
  message: ""
  status: success
  signature: awnc057e1a132p1jj3t4x
  spaminess: 0.7
  api-version: "1.1"
  spam: true
</textarea>

Notice how Defensio returned the spaminess and a signature ?  The signature can be used to retrain Defensio.  When a false positive or negative comes through, the "Defensio API":http://defensio.com/api simply accepts a series of signatures, and will retrain itself.  Since the signature is a short-hand for the whole comment, *all* of the data is available for retraining:  IP, author email, author name, comment's body, etc.

It is not obvious from the screenshot above (as I mostly get spammy comments), but there are actually many shades of orange to highlight the spaminess of comments.  Lighter shades are non-spammy, and darker ones, spammier.
