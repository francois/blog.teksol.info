I just released a new gem on RubyForge:  cliaws.  Using it, you have access to nice command line shortcuts:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>
$ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<the secret access key>"
$ clis3 list BUCKET/PATH-PREFIX
$ clis3 put BUCKET/FULL/PATH/NAME /path/to/local/file
$ clis3 get BUCKET/FULL/PATH/NAME /path/to/local/file
$ clis3 cat BUCKET/FULL/PATH/NAME
<% end -%>

This is not rocket science, but with the kind of work I'm doing at the moment, having quick command-line access to S3 is a boon.

h2. Installation

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ gem install cliaws
<% end -%>

h2. Direct-code access

<% code do -%>require "rubygems"
require "cliaws"

# Retrieve and store in a variable
value = Cliaws.s3.get("BUCKET/FULL/PATH/NAME")

# Retrieve and stream to specified file
File.open("/path/to/local/file", "w") do |f|
  Cliaws.s3.get("BUCKET/FULL/PATH/NAME", f)
end

# Returns an Array of full names
contents = Cliaws.s3.list("BUCKET")
<% end -%>
