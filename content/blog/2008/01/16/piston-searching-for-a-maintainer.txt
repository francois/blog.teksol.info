Due to "Real Life":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Life encroaching on my minimal spare time, I have decided I have no time to maintain "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/.  Therefore, as others have done, I am searching for a maintainer.

To qualify, you need to:

* have a Rubyforge account;
* be enthusiastic;
* and have a need to extend Piston.

Piston is my most successful Open Source project so far, and I want to put it in someone's capable hands.

Please send me mail to "francois@teksol.info":mailto:francois@teksol.info if you are interested ?

Are you this person ?
