Does anyone know why ActiveRecord does not merge joins when using scopes ?

Scopes are wonderful, thanks for "has_finder":http://pivots.pivotallabs.com/users/nick/blog/articles/284-hasfinder-it-s-now-easier-than-ever-to-create-complex-re-usable-sql-queries and "named scopes":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/3/24/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-has-finder-functionality, but joins aren't supported.  This code:

<% code do -%>City.nearest(latitude, longitude).find_tagged_with(tags)<% end -%>

raises an ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid complaining that a specified column could not be found.  The column can't be found because the join was dropped on the floor, instead of being merged.

The change me and "Marc-Andr√©":http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/ are proposing to make is this:

This is based on Rails 2.0.2, but Rails Edge has the same problem.  So, any ideas ?
