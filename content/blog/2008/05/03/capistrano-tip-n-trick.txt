If like me you didn't know, you can do that with "Capistrano":http://www.capify.org/:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="12" class="shell">$ cap HOSTS=web0.myapp.com deploy:update_code
cap ROLES=web,app deploy
</textarea>

Not terribly useful for the tasks demonstrated above, but what about this ?

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="12" class="shell">$ cap ROLES=app monit:summary
</textarea>

Incidentally, where are these documented ?  I dimly remembered reading this somewhere once, and tried it.  Works like a charm!
