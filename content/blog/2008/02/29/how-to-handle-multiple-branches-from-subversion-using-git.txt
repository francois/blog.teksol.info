Well, it turns out somebody (probably named dmo?) did all the hard work: "Multiple branches using git-svn":http://www.dmo.ca/blog/20070608113513

If you're like me, you need to track multiple branches in the same "Git":http://git.or.cz/ repository.  I'm going to use this extensively in the "XLsuite":http://xlsuite.com/ repository.  I have 2 trunks/mainlines: one for the closed source, and one for the open sourced version, I also have a stable version, and some work in progress branches.
