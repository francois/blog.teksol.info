I just found about "Cerberus":http://cerberus.rubyforge.org/.  This looks like a nice tool, and very easy to setup and run:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="10" class="shell">$ sudo gem install --include-dependencies cerberus
$ cerberus add PROJECT_DIR|PROJECT_URL
$ cerberus buildall
</textarea>

Very simple and clean.

I'm trying it out and will have more to post later on.
