I would like to provide you with an interesting link:  "How to Get Hired -- What CS Students Need to Know":http://www.kegel.com/academy/getting-hired.html

When I was "searching for someone":http://jobs.rubynow.com/jobs/show/271 myself, I hadn't read this essay, but I already knew I was searching for someone who is "Smart and Gets Things Done":http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html.

Those two articles pretty much sum up what I want from anyone I would be hiring.
