"James Robertson":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView of "Cincom Smalltalk":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/cincom/blogView features my "TodoApp on Seaside in 218 lines":http://blog.teksol.info/2007/10/15/todoapp-on-seaside-in-218-lines in his "Smalltalk Daily":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/casts/stDaily/ series.  The episode is available at "smalltalk_daily-10-15-07.html":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/casts/stDaily/2007/smalltalk_daily-10-15-07.html 

I would like to publicly thank James for taking the time to do the screencast, and assure him that the way he pronounces my last name is quite correct.

In case you aren't following my "Monticello repository":http://mirror.teksol.info/monticello/todo, the TodoApp is now at revision 5, including a bunch of fixes "Ramon Leon":http://onsmalltalk.com/ suggested.  TodoApp also stands at 233 lines, instead of the original 218.  I have a couple of refactorings in mind, so the line count will probably go down.
