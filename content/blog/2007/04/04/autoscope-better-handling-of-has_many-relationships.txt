Ain't "Release Early, Release Often":http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html wonderful ?  I just received  a patch from "Evgeniy Pirogov":http://ep.blogware.com/blog that makes the failing test from the "AutoScope":http://xlsuite.org/plugins/auto_scope plugin work.

Evgeniy's patch is available "here":http://ep.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2007/4/4/2858437.html, but you should simply "svn":http://subversion.tigris.org/ or "piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ update to get the latest version, since I eagerly accepted Evgeniy's patch.

Thank you, Evgeniy for your work.
