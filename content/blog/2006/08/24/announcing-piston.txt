Have you ever done a release using "Capistrano":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17, only to have it fail because an <code>svn:externals</code> update failed ?  Yeah, you know the feeling.  Happens to me all the time.  Plus the deploy task takes way too long when the server has to make all those queries to remote servers, most of which you do not know if they will still be there tomorrow.

h3. Introducing Piston

"Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ is a command line utility that copies a remote repository's content to your working copy.  Having a local copy of the code gives you many benefits:

* Faster updates on the server (only one repository is contacted);
* Less dependent on external code repositories (they might disappear, be offline at a critical time, or even corrupted);
* Ability to apply patches and enhancements without waiting for the patch to be applied upstream.

h3. Installation

<typo:code>$ gem install piston
Successfully installed piston, version 1.0.1
</textarea>

There is no need to install "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ on your server.  A local installation on your development machine is all that you need to administer the remote code.

h3. Examples

For a Rails project:

<typo:code>$ piston import \
  http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk \
  vendor/rails
Exported r4818 from 'http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk' to 'vendor/rails'

$ svn st -N vendor
A      vendor/rails
</textarea>

As you can see, "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ copied the full contents of Rails Edge to my working copy.
