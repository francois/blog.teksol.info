I just hit a case which I think will interest the community at large.

Did you know it is possible to conditionnaly define methods ?  Something like this is quite possible:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="15" class="ruby" title="app/models/player.rb">class Player < User
  if 'test' == RAILS_ENV then
    # Conditional method definition to ease testing
    def play_in(tournament, final_score)
      ...
    end
  end
end
</textarea>

Is that a code smell, or is it a really useful feature ?  I can't decide...

The method defined above removes three lines of code from each of the tests where my players play in a tournament.  And since this is what the site is about, I think I just slashed a few hundred lines of code from my functional  and integration tests.  That is not trivial.
