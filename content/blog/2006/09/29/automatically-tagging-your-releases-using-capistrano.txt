Even though "Capistrano":http://rubyforge.org/projects/capistrano "tags" each release by creating a new folder on the production server(s), it might be interesting to have a historical perspective in your repository anyway.

This makes it easier to know exactly what went up for a release.

I would like to share the following "Capistrano":http://rubyforge.org/projects/capistrano recipe for your pleasure:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="15" class="ruby" title="config/deploy.rb">require 'uri'
task :after_deploy do
  source = repository
  dest = URI.parse(repository).merge("../releases/#{File.basename(release_path)}")
  cmd = "svn copy --revision=#{revision} --quiet --message \"Auto tagging release #{release_path}\" #{source} #{dest}"
  puts cmd
  `#{cmd}`
end
</textarea>

First, we start by requiring "uri":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/uri/rdoc/index.html, because "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ does not like relative URLs.

Next, we find the location into which to tag the release, and finally, we just do it.

Simple, effective.

Enjoy !
