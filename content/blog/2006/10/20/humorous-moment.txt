I use the "Money":http://rubyforge.org/projects/money gem quite a bit in my Rails applications.  One thing I needed was to often add or substract one penny from an amount.  So, I did like all good programmers should do:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="13" class="ruby" title="lib/money_extensions.rb">class Money
  Penny = Money.new(1).freeze
end
</textarea>

Turns out that when using the constant, it ends up looking like this:

<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="13" class="ruby">amount -= Money::Penny
</textarea>

I never knew I'd have a "Bond Girl":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_girl in my "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ code :)
