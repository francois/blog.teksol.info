talked about "Speeding up Test Runs with fork":http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2006/04/08/speeding-up-test-runs-with-fork.  He uses Unix's <code class="function">fork</code>, which is great, except if you're on Windows.

What if (on Windows only) the server process restarted and waited for the next connection ?  We Windows developer would be paying the price of starting up the Rails environment, but it would happen in the background, while I am coding the next behavior, or implementing the last one.
