A minor correction to "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/:

* Import subcommand would fail with a "svn: Explicit target required ('vendor/rails' interpreted as prop value)" error.  This was a minor error in the import code.  Reported by Daniel N.
* The import subcommand could import another revision than what was intended, if HEAD was updated while the import is in progress.

Install using:
<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ gem install piston
<% end -%>
