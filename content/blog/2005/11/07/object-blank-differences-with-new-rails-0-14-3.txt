Just got bitten by a bug.  In a model, I was doing:
<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="15" class="ruby">self.unit_price = self.product.current_price(Date.today) \
  if self.unit_price.cents.blank?
</textarea>

After upgrading to "Rails 0.14.3":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2005/11/07/rails-1-0-rc4-0-14-3-its-the-final-countdown, I found some failures in my tests.  About 30 minutes of sleuthing around, and I found my bug to be with the "new object.blank? behavior":http://dev.rubyonrails.com/ticket/2705.

Some console code to "prove" it:
<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ ruby script\console
Loading development environment.
>> 0.blank?
=> true
>> exit

$ svn up vendor\rails
...
 U   vendor\rails
Updated external to revision 2932.

$ ruby script\console
Loading development environment.
>> 0.blank?
=> false
<% end -%>

So, I rewrote my code to now do:
<textarea name="code" cols="55" rows="15" class="ruby">self.unit_price = self.product.current_price(Date.today) \
  if 0 == self.unit_price.cents
</textarea>

Again, this shows how a good set of unit and functional tests can help prevent problems before they hit you.
