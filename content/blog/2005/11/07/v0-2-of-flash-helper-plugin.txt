Release 0.2 is now upon us.  Release 0.1, described in "Flash Helper Plugin - Flash Standardization":http://blog.teksol.info/articles/2005/11/05/flash-helper-plugin-flash-standardization was so broken as to be unusable.  From "bad requires, to invalid syntax and missing classes/modules":http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/28239, things looked pretty bleak.

Fortunately, things are better.  Release 0.2 has no new features, but at least, it has the benefit of working.

Installation stays the same:

* <code>svn export http://opensvn.csie.org/flash_helper_plugin/tags/0.2 vendor/plugins/flash_helper</code>
* <code>svn propset svn:externals vendor/plugins flash_helper http://opensvn.csie.org/flash_helper_plugin/tags/0.2</code> *be very careful with this one*
* "Download from RubyForge.org":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1068 and unpack into vendor/plugins

Everyone, "report any bugs":https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/flash_helper_plugin/trac.cgi/report/1 and enjoy !
