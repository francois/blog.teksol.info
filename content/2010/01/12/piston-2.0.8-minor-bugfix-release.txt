Piston 2.0.8 is here.  This is a minor bugfix release:

* piston status with no path would not check any status.  Thanks to "Michael Grosser":http://pragmatig.wordpress.com/ for the heads up;
* The ActiveSupport gem deprecated require "activesupport" in favor of "active_support". Thanks for Michael for reporting this as well;
* "Scott Johnson":http://github.com/scottj97 reported and fixed a problem where a git mv would fail because a parent directory was missing.

Thanks to all contributors!

h2. Installing

<% code do %>$ gem install piston
<% end %>
