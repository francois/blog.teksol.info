I spend 70% to 90% of my day in a full-screen "iTerm":http://iterm.sourceforge.net/, in Vim. I find it ironic that I use a 3kCAD machine to do what "green screen terminals":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_screen_display did 30 years ago... My iTerm's color scheme is green text on a black background. I read somewhere that this color combination was the easiest on eyes, but can't find the reference right now.

When I'm not in Vim, I'm usually in Safari or Firefox. What does *your* day look like?
