Active Record has a nice feature that enables the programmer to separate concerns.  In the application I am building, I need to reject some transactions based on business rules.  For example, if an attacker attemps to empty an account by requesting multiple payouts, or attempting to load more than a specific amount of money in the user's account.

In this application, I am using STI (Single Table Inheritance) to represent the different types of transaction.  The hierarchy looks like this:

<% code do -%>class GreenbackTransaction < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class AccountRechargeTransaction < GreenbackTransaction
end

class AccountPayoutTransaction < GreenbackTransaction
end
<% end -%>

I defined my observer like this:

<% code("app/models/greenback_transaction_observer.rb") do -%>class GreenbackTransactionObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
  def after_create(txn)
    # Code to reject the transaction if it is suspicious
  end
end
<% end -%>

Using the console, everything was working fine.  So, off I went to write a test for it (I know, it should have been the other way around, but I haven't used observers much, and I wanted to see what was going on).

My test is defined like this:

<% code("test/unit/greenback_transaction_observer_test.rb") do -%>class GreenbackTransactionObserverTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  fixtures :greenback_transactions, :users, :accounts, :affected_accounts
  
  def setup
    @sam = users(:sam)
    Setting.recharge_amount_threshold = 150.to_money
  end
  
  def test_suspicious_transaction_rejected
    assert_nothing_raised do
      AccountRechargeTransaction.new(:account => @sam.account, :amount => 100.to_money)
    end
    
    assert_raise(TransactionFailureException) do
      AccountRechargeTransaction.new(:account => @sam.account, :amount => 100.to_money)
    end
  end
end
<% end -%>

To my complete surprise, this didn't work.  After much investigation, I found that the observer was not loaded for GreenbackTransaction.  After some fooling around, adding logging statements in Rails core, I finally stumbled upon the solution:

<% code("app/models/account_recharge_transaction_observer.rb") do -%>class AccountRechargeTransactionObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
  observe AccountRechargeTransaction

  def after_create(txn)
    # Code to reject the transaction if it is suspicious
  end
end
<% end -%>

The problem was the observer was registered on <code class="class">GreenbackTransaction</code>, and it seems the observers aren't inherited in subclasses.  This is important and bears repeating: *if you use STI and observers, observe your subclasses !*.
