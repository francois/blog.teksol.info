Just had a bit of a problem today.  I wanted to test access to some actions, but with cookies.  I had to dig pretty deeply before I found what I needed.

When setting your cookies in the test, use <code class="class">CGI::Session</code>, and not a pure <code class="class">Hash</code>:

<% code do -%>class AccessDownloadsByCookieTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    @controller = AttachmentsController.new
    @request    = ActionController::TestRequest.new
    @response   = ActionController::TestResponse.new

    # WARNING: this is easy to fake, so don't do that
    # if you require real security
    @request.cookies['auth'] = CGI::Cookie.new('auth', '1')
    get :download
  end

  def test_access_granted_to_resource_by_cookie
    assert_response :success
  end
end
<% end -%>
