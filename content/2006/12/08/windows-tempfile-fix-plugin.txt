This is the initial release of the Windows Tempfile Fix plugin.  This plugin sets out to make Tempfile binary safe on Windows.

h2. Installation

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ piston import svn://svn.teksol.info/svn/rails/plugins/windows_tempfile_fix vendor\plugins\windows_tempfile_fix
<% end -%>

Alternatively:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ ruby script/plugin install svn://svn.teksol.info/svn/rails/plugins/windows_tempfile_fix
<% end -%>

h2. README

As I reported on my blog at
http://blog.teksol.info/articles/2006/12/08/rmagick-and-jpeg-datastream-contains-no-image,
the Windows version of Ruby will fail to load certain files when they are used
through a Tempfile.  This is because the Tempfile class does not open it's files
in binary mode.

This plugin is *very* conservative.  It will not install itself if it does
not detect the exact version it is supposed to be used against.

This plugin will only do it's work if it the following expression evaluates
to +true+:
 RUBY_PLATFORM == "i386-mswin32" && RUBY_VERSION == "1.8.4"
