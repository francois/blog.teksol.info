While convalescing from a recent "surgery":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy, I had a flash of insight.  One can view the Internet and a file system as one big, really big, Hash.

What is a Hash if not a way to access a value referenced by a key ?

What is a filename ? A key.

What is a URL ?  A key.

<% code("the_internet.rb") do -%>require 'uri'
require 'open-uri'
require 'singleton'

# Access the Internet through a Hash-like interface
# Code originally written by
#     François Beausoleil (francois@teksol.info)
# This code is released in the public domain.
class TheInternet
  include Singleton

  def [](url)
    uri = url.respond_to?(:read) ? url : URI.parse(url)
    uri.read
  end

  def []=(url, value)
    # POST, PUT or whatever to URL
  end
end
<% end -%>

<% code("filesystem.rb") do -%>require 'singleton'

# Access the filesystem through a Hash-like interface
# Code originally written by
#     François Beausoleil (francois@teksol.info)
# This code is released in the public domain.
class Filesystem
  include Singleton

  def [](path)
    File.read(path)
  end

  def []=(path, value)
    File.open(path, 'wb') do |f|
      f.write(value)
      # Could do fancy stuff here:
      # YAMLize value, marshall it, etc.
    end
  end
end
<% end -%>

The above allows us to do very interesting things:

<% code do -%>
# Copy from the Internet to a local file:
Filesystem.instance['teksol.info/index.html'] =
  TheInternet.instance['http://blog.teksol.info/']

# Given a suitable implementation of TheInternet#[]=,
# we could do:
search_results =
  (TheInternet.instance['http://www.google.com/search'] =
    {:hl => 'en', :q => 'rails'})
<% end -%>

Is this rambling interesting ?  Certainly.  Is it useful ?  You tell me !

*DISCLAIMER*: The Filesystem object above is full of security holes.  It should be implemented in a "chrooted":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot, environment, check permissions, etc.
