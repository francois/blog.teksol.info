I installed the "AssetPackager":http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/assetpackager plugin.  "Scott":http://synthesis.sbecker.net/, the manager of the plugin, suggests running the <code>asset:packager:build_all</code> task after the symlink phase.

I disagree with that because as soon as the symlink is done, it means we're live.  We haven't yet built the files, so users will receive "404s":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_error instead of the compressed files.

Instead, I suggest doing it after updating the code.  So, his Capistrano task changes to this instead:

<% code("config/deploy.rb") do -%>task :after_update_code, :roles => [:web] do
  run <<-EOF
    cd #{release_path} &&
    rake RAILS_ENV=production asset:packager:build_all
  EOF
end
<% end -%>

Unrelated note:  From the comments on Scott's "announcement":http://synthesis.sbecker.net/articles/2006/06/19/assetpackager-released#comments (see Timur Vafin's comments), I am not the only one writing asse*r*t_packager.  Must be all those darn assertions I write all day long...
