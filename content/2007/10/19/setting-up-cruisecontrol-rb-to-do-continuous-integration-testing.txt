I'm just setting up "Continuous Integration":http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html for all of our branches on "XLsuite.com":http://xlsuite.com/.  Doing a search for "cruisecontrol.rb" on Google unearthed:  "Ci For The Web 2.0 Guy Or Gal":http://www.slideshare.net/thewoolleyman/ci-for-the-web-20-guy-or-gal/.  I'm running the steps right now on my "RimuHosting":http://www.rimuhosting.com/ <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>.

Things are progressing along quite rapidly.  I'll say more when I'm done.
