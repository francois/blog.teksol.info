Well, after a long time, I finally made the plunge.  This blog is now running on "Mephisto":http://mephistoblog.com/.  The upgrade went rather smoothly (from "Typo":http://typosphere.org/), following the instructions on "Converting Typo to Mephisto":http://mephisto.stikipad.com/help/show/Converting+Typo+to+Mephisto.

Mephisto handles most redirects itself, so here's my redirection section in <code class="file">config/environment.rb</code>:

<% code("config/environment.rb") do -%>Mephisto::Routing.redirect  "articles/?/?/?/?" => "$1/$2/$3/$4",
                            "articles/tag/?" => "tags/$1",
                            "articles/category/?" => "tags/$1"
<% end -%>

I had to use "Apache":http://httpd.apache.org/'s "RewriteRule":http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule to take care of Typo's feeds:

<% code("vhost.conf", :lang => "conf") do -%># Stick this in your .htaccess file

# Allow FeedBurner to index the site, but redirect everyone else to FeedBurder
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !FeedBurner
RewriteRule ^/feed.* http://feeds.feedburner.com/teksol [R=301,L]

# Redirect old feed URLs to FeedBurner
RewriteRule ^/xml.* http://feeds.feedburner.com/teksol [R=301,L]
<% end -%>

And I *finally* changed my blog's feed to "FeedBurder":http://feedburner.com/.  Subscribe to the new URL:  "http://feeds.feedburner.com/teksol":http://feeds.feedburner.com/teksol.  I configured Apache to take care of it automatically, so you shouldn't have to do anything to get your news reader to switch.

If you're wondering, the theme is a slightly modified TerraFirma.  View the theme at the "Mephisto Themes Gallery":http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/gallery.

With this change, I will also post more regularly, as my Typo installation was pretty unstable.

See ya !
