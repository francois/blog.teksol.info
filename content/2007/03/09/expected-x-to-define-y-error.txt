I just got hit by this famous error again.  And I am not the only one:

* Aug 2006:  "Expected ... to define ...":http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/77708
* Dec 2006: "Weird error trying to define controller?":http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=2716
* Jan 2007: "rails 1.2.1":http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/94356
* "Ticket #7452":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/7452 (there are more)
* "Google search on this error message":http://www.google.ca/search?q=expected+%22to+define%22+rails+dependencies++%2Bload_missing_constant&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:fr:official&client=firefox-a

Now, I know I should put my patches where my mouth is.  And that's exactly what I'm trying to do here.  My application is on the 1.2 branch, and I get this error if I have the Response Logger plugin loaded.  Trying again with Edge Rails, I again get the error.  If I try with WEBrick or Mongrel, same error.  Loading the console produces the same error.  Using Windows or Linux changes nothing: same error.

The exact backtrace is:
<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ ruby script\console

In this application, I am using "Engines":http://rails-engines.org/, along with LoginEngine.  You really need the right version of Engines with the right version of Rails for things to work out well:  "Rails 1.2":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/branches/1-2-stable requires "Engines 1.2":http://svn.rails-engines.org/engines/tags/rel_1.2.0/.
