For example:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ piston switch http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_1-2-1 vendor\rails
Processing 'vendor\rails'...
  Fetching remote repository's latest revision and UUID
  Restoring remote repository to known state at r6010
  Updating remote repository to http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/tags/rel_1-2-1@5990
  Processing adds/deletes
  Removing temporary files / folders
  Updating Piston properties
  Updated to r5990 (663 changes)
<% end -%>

Piston 1.3.0 also shows the revision number of locked directories.

h2. Installation

As usual, nothing could be simpler:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ sudo gem install --include-dependencies piston
<% end -%>
