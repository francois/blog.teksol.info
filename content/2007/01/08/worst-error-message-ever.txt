SSL negotiation failed: SSL error: decryption failed or bad record mac (https://svn.xlsuite.org)
<% end -%>

There exists "When performing Subversion operations involving a lot of data over SSL, I get the error SSL negotiation failed: SSL error: decryption failed or bad record mac":http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#ssl-negotiation-error on the Subversion FAQ.  But I searched for that after the fact.

Turns out the error was related to a bad password.  Talk about misleading...
