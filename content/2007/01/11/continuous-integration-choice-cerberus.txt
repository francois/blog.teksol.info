I just found about "Cerberus":http://cerberus.rubyforge.org/.  This looks like a nice tool, and very easy to setup and run:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ sudo gem install --include-dependencies cerberus
$ cerberus add PROJECT_DIR|PROJECT_URL
$ cerberus buildall
<% end -%>

Very simple and clean.

I'm trying it out and will have more to post later on.
