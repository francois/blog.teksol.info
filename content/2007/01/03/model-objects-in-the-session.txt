A bit more than a year ago, I wrote about "model serialization in session":http://blog.teksol.info/articles/2005/10/21/model-serialization-in-session, in which I advocated to implement <code class="method">dump</code> and <code class="method">load</code> methods in your model to only marshal the object's ID instead of the full object's properties.

Today, I found about the "object_id_session plugin":http://rashkovskii.com/articles/2007/01/02/object_id_session, which has the same purpose, but a different implementation.
