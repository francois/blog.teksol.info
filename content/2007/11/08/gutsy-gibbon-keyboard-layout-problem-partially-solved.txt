I just posted about my problem with the English US keyboard not having a pipe character ?  Well, I removed the French Canadian keyboard layout from my configuration, and now I have my pipe character back.  That's not very nice, since I won't be able to type in French anymore, but at least, I can program again.

Thanks to "dvorak keyboard layout but keyboard shortcuts are in qwrty":http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=601586 for the idea.
