I was writing a test for a method named <code class="method ruby">hit!</code> and I wrote the following:

<% code do -%>def test_calling_hit!_increments_hit_count
  # ...
end
<% end -%>

Running the tests didn't pick this up.  I renamed the method to:

<% code do -%>def test_calling_hit_bang_increments_hit_count
  # ...
end
<% end -%>

And that obviously worked.  So, Ruby accepts ! and ? as *suffixes*, but not anywhere else.  Of course, using "Shoulda":http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda I wouldn't have had the problem, since I would have written:

<% code do -%>context "Calling #hit!" do
  should "increment the hit counter by one" do
    # ...
  end
end
<% end -%>

Notice the bang is within a String, so no problem there.
