One thing's for sure, it's not obvious what's going on when a test fails because of cookies.  For that reason, I shied away from using cookies significantly.

Anyway, here's a failure I was getting:
<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>  1) Failure:
test_create_session_with_right_username_and_password_and_remember_me(CreateSessionsControllerTest)
    [test/functional/sessions_controller_test.rb:57:in `test_create_session_with_right_username_and_password_and_remember_me'
     /home/francois/src/config/../vendor/plugins/mocha/lib/mocha/test_case_adapter.rb:19:in `run']:
No :auth_token cookie in the response
 ---
auth_token:
- cookie value
<% end -%>

Turns out the @response.cookies Hash is not indifferent.  You really have to use a String to get to the content:

<% code do -%>def test_cookie_set
  assert_equal ["some value"], @response.cookies["auth_token"],
    "this will succeed"
  assert_equal ["some value"], @response.cookies[:auth_token],
    "this will always fail"
end
<% end -%>
