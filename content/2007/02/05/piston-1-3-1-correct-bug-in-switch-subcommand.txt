Piston 1.3.0 introduced the switch subcommand, but it did not do one important thing:  it did not remember what new repository root we are reading from.  Version 1.3.1 corrects that.

The CHANGELOG says:
<pre>2007-03-09 1.3.1
* piston switch would fail if the branch from which we are reading had been
  deleted.
* piston switch had a major bug.  It did not update the piston:root property
  to remember the new repository root.  Reported and fixed by Graeme
  Mathieson.
* piston switch errors out early if not provided with the right arguments.
  Thanks to Graeme Mathieson for the info and patch.
* New internal command parser.  No visible external changes.
</pre>

Piston is a utility that eases vendor branch management. This is similar to <tt>svn:externals</tt>, except you have a local copy of the files, which you can modify at will.  As long as the changes are mergeable, you should have no problems.

Download using the usual command:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ sudo gem install --include-dependencies piston
<% end -%>
