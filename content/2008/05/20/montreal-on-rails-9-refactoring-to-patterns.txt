I'm speaking about my work on refactoring Mephisto on Tuesday, May 20th at 7 PM.  My presentation is entitled: "Refactoring to Patterns:  How Mephisto went from a single engine Lada to a multi-engine jet fighter".

"Hope to see you there":http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/609657/ !  Please be sure to confirm your presence.  Also, Carl is trying a new format.  Instead of 3 talks, there will only be one.  After that, it's party time!
