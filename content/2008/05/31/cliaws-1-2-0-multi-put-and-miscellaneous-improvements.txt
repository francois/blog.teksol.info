I just pushed "1.2.0":http://github.com/francois/cliaws/tree/1.2.0 to "GitHub":http://github.com/ as well as "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/.  This release has a single major improvement:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ clis3 put A B local/C bucket/dir/
A => bucket/dir/A
B => bucket/dir/B
local/C => bucket/dir/C
<% end -%>

<code>put</code> isn't yet recursive, and note the caveat above: all paths are flattened to their basenames.  Enjoy!
