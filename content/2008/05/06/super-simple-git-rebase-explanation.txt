"James Bowes":http://jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/ has a *super simple* "git-rebase":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html explanation: "git rebase: keeping your branches current":http://jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/2007/01/26/git-rebase-keeping-your-branches-current/.

If you have any difficulty understanding the concept, or want an easy way to explain to someone, go ahead.

I'm just starting to use "git-svn":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html and git-rebase, and the combination rocks.
