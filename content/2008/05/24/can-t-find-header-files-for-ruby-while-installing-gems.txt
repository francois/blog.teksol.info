I just got a MacBook Pro (my first Mac!) and couldn't install many gems.  All had native dependencies.  All failed similarly:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ sudo gem install god
Password:
Updating metadata for 1 gems from http://gems.rubyforge.org/
.
complete
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing god:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby extconf.rb install god
can't find header files for ruby.


Gem files will remain installed in /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/god-0.7.6 for inspection.
Results logged to /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/god-0.7.6/ext/god/gem_make.out
<% end -%>

I finally found the solution on the "MacRuby":http://ruby.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/MacRuby "Troubleshooting: can't find header files for ruby":http://ruby.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/Troubleshooting#cantfindheaderfilesforruby page.

Hope this helps someone else.
