If like me you didn't know, you can do that with "Capistrano":http://www.capify.org/:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ cap HOSTS=web0.myapp.com deploy:update_code
cap ROLES=web,app deploy
<% end -%>

Not terribly useful for the tasks demonstrated above, but what about this ?

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ cap ROLES=app monit:summary
<% end -%>

Incidentally, where are these documented ?  I dimly remembered reading this somewhere once, and tried it.  Works like a charm!
