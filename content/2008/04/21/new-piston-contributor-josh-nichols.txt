I just received 2 contributions from "Josh Nichols":http://technicalpickles.com/:

* New --repository-type option on piston import to force the repository backend to use (instead of letting Piston guess), and for cases where Piston is unable to guess: "ea958dd":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/ea958dd2711364eab793c135e07171c9603a23e3;
* Test suite reorganization: "1cef7b6":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/1cef7b69dff6ad3bd62e5127a38f2de73ee89456 and "9cfa8f3":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/9cfa8f32cfb975bc1ce32746c4567b9b3915ea45

Both contributions were accepted and are now part of Piston's master branch.  Thank you very much, Josh, for your work.
