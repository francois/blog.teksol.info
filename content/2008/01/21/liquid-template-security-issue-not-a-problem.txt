Well, it seems I jumped the gun.  In "Security issue in Liquid::Template":http://blog.teksol.info/2008/1/18/security-issue-in-liquid-template, I thought I had a found a problem with the "Liquid":http://code.google.com/p/liquid-markup/ template engine.  Instead, I should have looked more closely at what *I* do:

<% code("app/controllers/pages_controller.rb") do -%>class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    # ...
    render(:inline => @page.render, :layout => false)
  end
end
<% end -%>

The details can be found at "#render":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000452 on the Ruby on Rails API.  Seems like it's time for us to switch to using <code>render :text</code>.

I am sorry for any scare I caused.  If I had run a separate test case, I'd have immediately seen I was in error, and not Liquid.
