In "XLsuite":http://xlsuite.com/, we use "Liquid templates":http://www.liquidmarkup.org/ in the CMS.  Two days ago, I noticed a big problem:  ERB code in the Liquid template ends up being eval'd.  This is in direct contradiction with Liquid's mission statement:

bq. Ruby library for rendering safe templates which cannot affect the security of the server they are rendered on.

I'm reposting this here so this gets the attention it deserves.
