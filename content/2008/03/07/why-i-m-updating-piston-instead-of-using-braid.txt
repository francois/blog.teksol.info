bq. You might want to check out "braid":http://evil.che.lu/projects/braid, formerly known as giston.

I knew about Braid.  The way I see it, Braid *requires* "Git":http://git.or.cz/.  Without it, it is useless.  What I want to do with Piston instead is to be completely repository and working copy agnostic.  Use the best possible solution given the tools at hand:  Subversion properties when appropriate, YAML files if I can't.  Use Git to merge if possible, do it using Subversion if I can't.  And so on.

I even had a request for supporting SVK by "Faisal":http://faisal.com/.  It will be very important for me to allow any combination of server/working copy.  Anyway, more code, less talk.  Once I have a workinjg release, you'll be able to judge the quality of my work.
