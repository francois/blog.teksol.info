<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
$ echo $?
1
<% end -%>

Shouldn't a successful git status in a git repository return a status code of 0 ?  Doing it in a random folder returns a sensible value:

<% code(:lang => "shell") do -%>$ git status
fatal: Not a git repository
Failed to find a valid git directory.
$ echo $?
128
<% end -%>

Can anybody shed some light on this ?

I found "Possible bug in 'git status' exit code is 1 instead of 0":http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/git/0701/36671.html.  What is the rational for this ?  It goes against everything Unix ?!?
