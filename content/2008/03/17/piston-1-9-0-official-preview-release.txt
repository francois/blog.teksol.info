I'm making it official.  I'm releasing 1.9.0 today:

http://github.com/francois/piston/tree/1.9.0

I'll put up a gem tomorrow, but if you want to play with Piston now, the best way is to either clone the repository, or grab a "tarball":http://github.com/francois/piston/tarball/1.9.0 directly from GitHub.

What's implemented in this release ?

* piston import

But you can import from either SVN or Git, into either SVN or Git.  All Piston metadata is stored in a .piston.yml file in the pistonized dir's root.

If you have questions, problems, comments, go ahead and comment right here, or use "Piston's tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=2105
