I have new integration tests, and they work just beautifully.  I'm missing a couple more, but things are looking very good.

Thanks to "Paul Watson":http://thisoldcoder.com/ for finding and fixing two bugs in the Git/Git case.

Finally, I have "faisal":http://faisal.com/ which offered looking into adding "SVK":http://svk.elixus.org/ support for the working copy.
