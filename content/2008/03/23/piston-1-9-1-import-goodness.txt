Well, with much more testing, I'm releasing another preview release of "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/.  This release should import "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ or "Git":http://git.or.cz/ repositories into Subversion or Git working copies just fine.  There's one slight problem, which is when you use <code class="command">piston import URL</code> (without a target directory), it will import into a folder named <code class="dir">repository</code>, which isn't what it's supposed to do.  I'm missing a couple of tests, is all.

How to grab this release ?  Two ways:

* <code class="command">git clone git://github.com/francois/piston.git</code>
* Grab a "tarball":http://github.com/francois/piston/tarball/1.9.1

Once you have the code, run <code class="command">rake install_gem</code> to install the gem.  Enjoy !
