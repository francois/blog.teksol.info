Now that I've had a good change to play with Git, I'm ready to implement Git support in Piston.  This will involve a couple of refactorings.  I can see 4 cases currently:

|Repository|Working Copy|Strategy|
|Subversion|Subversion|Use current strategy of storing data in Subversion properties|
|Subversion|Git|Clone the Git repository, copy the files over and store the metadata as Subversion properties.  Use Git to handle the merging for Piston (Yay!)|
|Git|Subversion|svn export the data and use a hidden YAML file to store the metadata in the pistonized directory|
|Git|Git|Use Git submodules perhaps ?  Or git clone + copy + YAML|

I have no idea how git submodules work, so I can't really say that I will be handling that last case in the most efficient manner.  I'm planning on having completed this work by the end of next week (March 14th).  Stay tuned for details !
