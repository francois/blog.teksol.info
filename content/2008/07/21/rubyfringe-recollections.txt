I had so much fun at "RubyFringe":http://rubyfringe.com/ that I don't want to go!  I'm in the "Metropolitan":http://metropolitan.com/'s lobby, and writing this.  I almost have a tear in my eyes.  What fond recollections I will cherish for a long time to come.

Thanks to the "Unspace":http://www.unspace.ca/ crew (Pete, Megan, "Hampton":http://hamptoncatlin.com/ and the others I haven't thanked personally but who did an *amazing* job) for making this event.

This was my first conference ever, and it was great.  As Pete said, <q>I'm happy we took your conference virginity.</q>
