*WOW*  Initially, "What Does this Error Mean?":http://whatdoesthiserrormean.com/ had a pretty strong presence in the top leaderboard.  As the days went on, we slipped further and further down the scale.  We hovered between 10th and 15th on the general leaderboard.

I knew we could sort by different criterias, and I occasionaly looked at the leaderboard by other criterias, but I can't remember at what ranks we were.

In the end, we won *Most Useful*.  That is a very good thing for us.

Again, congratulations to all teams that participated, and I'm hoping to see another repeat for 2009.
