How's that for being helpful?

<% code :lang => :shell do %>$ rake db:migrate --trace

     3 CreateAccounts

Run "rake db:migrate" to update your database then try again.
<% end %>

Hmm, I'm trying to run migrations, stupid&hellip;

I finally traced the problem (using "git bisect":http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-bisect !) to this:

<% code "lib/tasks/cucumber.rake" do %>$:.unshift(RAILS_ROOT + '/vendor/plugins/cucumber/lib')
require 'cucumber/rake/task'

namespace :test do
  desc "Runs the Cucumber features tests (integration tests)"
  Cucumber::Rake::Task.new(:features) do |t|
    ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = RAILS_ENV = "test"
    Rake::Task["db:test:prepare"].invoke
    Rake::Task["db:fixtures:load"].invoke
    t.cucumber_opts = "--format pretty"
  end
end
<% end %>

Can you spot the error?  The problem originates with setting RAILS_ENV in this code block.  But isn't the block supposed to be executed later?  When the block is #call'ed?  Very strange.  At the moment, I simply commented out the line, but that's going to bite me in a couple moments when I'm ready to test my features again&hellip;  Oh joy of debugging!
