During the "RailsRumble":http://railsrumble.com/, we really had to guard against future creep.  Jamis summarized it well in "Beware of future creep":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1324-beware-of-future-creep

<blockquote cite="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1324-beware-of-future-creep"><p>First, never implement more than you need to. That sounds harsh, in a grasshopper-and-the-ant kind of way, except it really isn’t. It isn’t a mandate to slack off, it’s a command to do what you know. Implement the feature you’re working on, not the feature you hope will land someday. Keep it simple, keep it minimal, and keep it _real_.</p>

While pairing with "Daniel":http://danielharan.com/, it happened to us a couple of times when he or I would say "What does our story say already?  Oh, let's add a story for later".  That was really the essence of the competition.  Delay *anything* (features, infrastructure, what have you) that could be delayed.

We're really excited about "What Does this Error Mean?":http://whatdoesthiserrormean.com/ and the way it panned out.  Happy "voting":http://railsrumble.com/team/team-giraffesoft !
