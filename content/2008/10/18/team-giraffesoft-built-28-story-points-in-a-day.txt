We used "Pivotal Tracker":http://pivotaltracker.com/ to track our stories to build.  Initially, I thought we'd do maybe 15 points in a day.  Looks like I was really, really, wrong:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="<%= same_folder_url("28-points-in-a-day.png") %>" alt="28 points in a day, according to Pivotal Tracker"/></p>

We delivered 28 story points in a single day.  Team GiraffeSoft really rocks!
