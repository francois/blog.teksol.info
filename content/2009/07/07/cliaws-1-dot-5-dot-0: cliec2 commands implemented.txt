Please grab cliaws from Rubyforge:

<% code do %>$ gem install cliaws
<% end %>

<h2>What is Cliaws?</h2>

Cliaws is a replacement for the Amazon EC2 API tools, but uses Ruby, and thus does not suffer from a long boot time.  Cliaws is also easier to setup:

<% code do %>$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=# Your Access ID
$ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=# Your secret ID
$ # Setup is done, enjoy!
$ clis3 list YOUR_BUCKET
$ cliec2 launch AMI --keypair KEYNAME
<% end %>

Please view the "README":http://github.com/francois/cliaws for some details.  The implementation is still the best place to get information about the options you can pass.
