I just release Piston 2.0.4.  This is a minor fix to enable Piston to work with more Git versions.

Git 1.6.0.1 accepts checking out a new branch without specifying the remote's name:

<% code do %>$ git checkout -b my-2-3-stable 2-3-stable
# implies origin/2-3-stable
<% end %>

Versions prior to that expect the full name of the remote branch:

<% code do %>$ git checkout -b my-2-3-stable origin/2-3-stable
<% end %>

Installation is the usual incantation:  sudo gem install piston

h2. What is Piston?

Piston is a utility that eases vendor branch management. This is similar to <tt>svn:externals</tt>, except you have a local copy of the files, which you can modify at will.  As long as the changes are mergeable, you should have no problems.
