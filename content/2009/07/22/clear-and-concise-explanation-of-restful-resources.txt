I just found "Your Web Service Might Not Be RESTful If&hellip;":http://www.theamazingrando.com/blog/?p=107 by "Paul Sadauskas":http://www.theamazingrando.com/blog/.  This article is a very clear and concise explanation of how to do real RESTful services.

His arguments are:

1. Present a single top-level resource;
2. All resources should be accessible by followling links from the top-level resource;
3. Don't put API tokens in the URL or headers (use representations instead).

A very enjoyable read, and something we should all be following.
