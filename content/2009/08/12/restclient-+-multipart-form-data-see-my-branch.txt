I just merged Rick Olson's ("technoweenie":http://techno-weenie.net/) rest-client "multipart_streaming":http://github.com/technoweenie/rest-client/tree/multipart_streaming branch with RestClient 1.0.4.  You can see the results at "francois/rest-client":http://github.com/francois/rest-client.  I sent a pull request to "Adam":http://adam.blog.heroku.com/, so if he pulls it in, everyone will benefit from this code.
