I just pulled in a couple of patches from outside contributors.  These are all minor bug fixes, but are important:

* "Chris Gibson":http://github.com/chrisgibson: When forcing the repository type, Piston would break because it called #downcase on a Symbol. "1bcc16bf8":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/1bcc16bf874afca88e061ea35cd049b7a1d38ab4
* Terry Heath:  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>'s <tt>--non-interactive</tt> would prevent OS X's keychain from kicking in. "93d9a957":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/93d9a9578f0947c62a70b52f86d8d4033cfb56ad
* Florian AÃŸmann: In certain cases, the revision would be a String, and other times it would be an Integer.  Normalize before comparing. "40c0bc4e":http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/40c0bc4e3c63aa398d319ec08846538705950e3d

All users are advised to upgrade:

<% code do %>$ sudo gem install piston
<% end %>
