Before today, I was using Thin to host my development servers.  This was a bother because I had to remember to start/stop Thins as required when I switched tasks.  Well, not anymore...

Reading my feeds today, I found "Passenger Preference Pane":http://www.fngtps.com/passenger-preference-pane, by "Fingertips":http://www.fngtps.com/.

<ol>
<li>Download the preference pane itself</li>
<li>Untar</li>
<li>Follow the directives in the README about RubyCocoa (either Leopard 10.5.2 or install RubyCocoa yourself from source)</li>
<li>Double click the prefpane: this will install the preference pane</li>
<li>Open Passenger in Other</li>
<li>Drag and drop your Rails (or Rack-based) application folder into the list</li>
<li>Click Apply</li>
<li>Go back to System Preferences, and open Network</li>
<li>Stop and start Apache using the checkbox for Web Sharing</li>
<li>Visit http://your-apps-base-name.local/ and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

One caveat I found was that my home directory had to change permissions.  I had to grant <tt>a+rx</tt> before it would work:

<% code :lang => "bash" do %> $ ls -ld ~
drwxr-xr-x+ 78 francois  staff  2652  9 f√©v 11:13 /Users/francois
<% end %>

Of course, if you have a multi-user machine, that opens an interesting can of worms for security.  A quick fix would be:

<% code :lang => "bash" do %>$ chmod a-rx * && chmod a+rx the-apps-base-name
<% end %>

Modify  as needed.
