Lately, I've been having fun with RubyCocoa while reading <a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/">Brian Marick</a>'s "RubyCocoa":http://pragprog.com/titles/bmrc/rubycocoa.  It's an entertaining book, and I really like RubyCocoa itself.  But I hit a little gotcha.  Take the following code:

<% code "PathController.rb" do %>require 'osx/cocoa'

class PathController < OSX::NSObject
  ib_outlet :path, :events
  ib_action :choosePath
  
  def choosePath(sender)
    panel = OSX::NSOpenPanel.openPanel
    panel.canChooseFiles          = false
    panel.canChooseDirectories    = true
    panel.allowsMultipleSelection = false

    result = panel.runModal
    if result == OSX::NSFileHandlingPanelOKButton then
      self.path.title = panel.filename
    end
  end
end
<% end %>

What could be wrong with this?  Turns out <code class="method">#ib_oulet</code> does not define accessors for the instance variables it defines.  Look at the exception:

<% code :lang => "none" do %>OSX::OCMessageSendException: Can't get Objective-C method signature for selector 'events' of receiver #<PathController:0x2297be class='PathController' id=0x534ec0>

<% end %>

From the obscure message, I gathered this was some kind of "NoMethodError":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/NoMethodError.html (why couldn't they use an exception with a good name?)  That was Sunday morning.  Sunday evening, I suddenly had a flash that ib_outlet wouldn't define an accessor.  Changed my code to use the instance variable instead:

<% code "PathController.rb" do %>if result == OSX::NSFileHandlingPanelOKButton then
  @path.title = panel.filename
end
<% end %>

Lo and behold!  It worked beautifully.
