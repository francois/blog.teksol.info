If you're in any way, shape or form like me, you usually have more energy in the morning (if you don't, skip this post).  My regular schedule puts me in my office around 9 AM every weekday.  First thing I do is pop open "Google Reader":http://google.com/reader, and start reading blogs.  What an utter waste of time...  I waste perfectly good coding time to do an activity that's similar to watching television.  I can _waste_ my time in the afternoon, when I have less energy.  I say _waste_ but I really mean *relax*.  Don't take me wrong: reading blogs is a very important time, but I should just do it when it's OK to do, not when I have the most energy.

Yesterday evening, I was pondering on the why of the above.  Turns out I can procrastinate just as well as anyone else...
