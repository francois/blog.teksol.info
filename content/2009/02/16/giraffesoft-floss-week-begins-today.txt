"James Golick":http://jamesgolick.com/ just opened our company blog by adding "FLOSS week":http://giraffesoft.com/blog/2009/02/16/floss-week.html.  Over the next few days we'll release a couple of plugins that we've been working on/with for the past few projects.

bq. Only problem is, we never get around to releasing this stuff. Starting a blog seemed like a good excuse to spend some time polishing up some code and, you know, writing READMEs.

Go on over and enjoy the view!  Don't forget the RSS feed:  "GiraffeSoft: The Blog":http://feeds.giraffesoft.ca/giraffesoft-the-blog
