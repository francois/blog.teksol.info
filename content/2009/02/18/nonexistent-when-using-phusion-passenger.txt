This evening, I was fooling around with mod_passenger for XLsuite.  I ran into a little problem where Passenger was telling me "No such file or directory - /nonexistent".  A quick search on Google revealed <a href="http://blog.scopeport.org/ruby-on-rails/phusion-passenger-error-file-directory-nonexistent/">Phusion Passenger error “No such file or directory - /nonexistent”</a>.

That post really made my day.
