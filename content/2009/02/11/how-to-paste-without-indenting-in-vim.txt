I wanted to paste some HTML into Vim, and I was having a hard time getting something that preserved existing indentation.

After doing <tt>:help autoindent</tt>, I found out about smartindent.  So, I turned both smartindent and autoindent off before doing my paste.  That worked wonders!

<% code :lang => :vim do %>:set nosmartindent
:set noautoindent
i
<CMD>-V
<ESC>
:set smartindent
:set autoindent
<% end %>

Voil√†, a correctly pasted, non-indented version of whatever was in the clipboard!
