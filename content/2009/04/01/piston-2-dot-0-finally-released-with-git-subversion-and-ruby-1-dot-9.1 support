It's been a long time coming, I know.  Believe me when I say so.  But the good news first:

* Piston 2.0 supports Git repositories and working copies
* Piston 2.0 supports Subversion repositories and working copies
* Piston 2.0 is Ruby 1.9.1 compliant

h3. Get it

(Allow a couple of hours for the gem to propagate)

<% code :lang => "shell" do %>$ sudo gem install piston
<% end %>

h3. The new website

Yes, I have a new look to go along with the website.  "http://piston.rubyforge.org/":http://piston.rubyforge.org/

There is also an avenue for asking questions and getting help about Piston.  Register to the "piston-discussion Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/piston-discussion

Please have fun and enjoy yourselves.

NOTE: This is not an April's Fool joke (although it would have been really cool to do it if I had thought so!)
