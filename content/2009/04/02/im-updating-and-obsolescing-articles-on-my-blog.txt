A couple of days ago, "@jfcouture":http://twitter.com/jfcouture tweeted:

bq. "@cmercier":http://twitter.com/cmercier People with stuff older than 6 months in the Rails world on their blog should do the same!

This was in response to Carl's rant that obsolete Merb tutorials should be removed / deprecated.

I decided to follow their advice.  I'm revisiting all my old posts and saying they are either obsolete, or providing links to replacements.  Expect to see at least a post a day for the next couple of weeks as I revisit my old posts.  This is interesting!  I had forgotten about a lot of things I had written about.
