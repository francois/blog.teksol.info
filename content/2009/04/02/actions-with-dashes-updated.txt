Back in October 2005, I wrote an article entitled "Actions with Dashes":http://blog.teksol.info/2005/10/25/actions-with-dashes.  This article is perfectly obsolete and uses a trick instead of the router as it was intended.

Let's say you want an action where the URL is <code>http://myproject.com/contact-us</code>.  The best way to do that currently is to use Rails' router:

<% code "config/routes.rb" do %>map.contact_us "/contact-us", :controller => "pages", :action => "show", :page => "contact_us"
<% end %>

<% code "app/controllers/pages_controller.rb" do %>class PagesController < ActionController
  def show
    render :action => params[:page]
  end
end
<% end %>

The <code class="class">PagesController</code> above is also good for any other static pages you want to serve on your site.
