"Git":http://git-scm.com/ is a wonderful system.  It has all kinds of nooks and crannies that one forgets about.  Anyway, I was doing client work this morning, and my build server ("Integrity":http://github.com/foca/integrity, but this isn't about Integrity) didn't fail, although my local tests were failing.  I began investigating, and <code class="path">vendor/plugins</code> wasn't even on the build server.  Uh?  I began investigating, and found <code class="path">vendor/plugins</code> had turned into a "git submodule":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html a while back.  I even had the commit's SHA1 of when that happened.  I found myself in the unenvious position of having to find and install every plugin we had before that commit back into the application.

<% code :lang => "bash" do %># 04f7e1 is the commit when the submodule was born
# Checkout the commit before that error occured
$ git checkout 04f7e1^
$ ls vendor/plugins > plugins
$ git checkout master
$ cat plugins
$ script/plugin install git://github.com/giraffesoft/timeline_fu.git
# And so on, for the 9 other plugins
<% end %>

And then, there was this one plugin which we haven't released yet which I was missing.  It's called configurable_mailer, and allows us to configure "ActionMailer::Base":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html from tests and from some environment variables.  Anyway, I again checked out the code from <code class="sha1">04f7e1^</code>, copied <code class="path">vendor/plugins/configurable_mailer</code> outside the repository, checked out master again, and moved the plugin back into place.  As you can imagine, this was painful.  And error-prone.  Then I ran my tests, and immediately had errors.  This application is based off of "Blank":http://github.com/giraffesoft/blank, and was using slightly modified versions of certain plugins.  So I added Blank as a remote, fetched and merged.  Ran my tests again.  Still had errors.  And lots of them:

Bad, I'm telling you.  Then I remembered something about "git checkout":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html being able to checkout certain paths.  I read about this somewhere but I can't find the source, anymore.  Sorry!  Without even reading the manual, I set out to work.

<% code :lang => "bash" do %>$ get checkout -b fix
$ git rm -r vendor/plugins
$ git checkout -m "Removing submodule'd vendor/plugins (how did that happen?)"
$ git checkout 04f7e1^ -- vendor/plugins
<% end %>

Wall clock time?  10 seconds.  I was ready to add and commit.

This is a post to remind you to know your tools, and know them well.  Sorry I can't stay anymore.  I'm off to read <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">autotest</a>'s source and documentation, again.
