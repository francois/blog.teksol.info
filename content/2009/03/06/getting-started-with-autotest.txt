Since yesterday, I read a bit more about "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/.  I stumbled on "Getting Started with Autotest":http://ph7spot.com/articles/getting_started_with_autotest which you should read immediately.  The article talks about setting up your plugins and doing all kinds of interesting things.

Getting more proficient with my tools now!
