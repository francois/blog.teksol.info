Being unsatisfied with the sleep tracker apps I used previously, I chose to write my own. In this series of blog posts, I'd like to document my decision making, in order to help other people struggling with the same types of decisions.

<ol>
<li>Part 1: Decision Making Process (you're reading this now)</li>
<li><a href="../07/nofrills-sleep-tracker-part-2-database-schema-design">Part 2: database schema design</a></li>
<li><a href="../08/nofrills-sleep-tracker-part-3-ui-rendering-and-the-react-model">Part 3: UI rendering and the React model</a></li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dt>Buy or build?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Well&hellip; that decision had been done a few times over. Reasons why I chose to build instead of buy include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Too many bells &amp; whistles, things which I didn't need (cardio meter on wakeup? fun, but not required);</li>
    <li>Graphs are cool, but only if they have the data I want, I want a histogram of number of hours slept, not a simple average;</li>
    <li>I don't need an alarm clock, iOS already does that for me;</li>
    <li>By the same token, I don't need a music player. I have a playlist whose duration is 21 minutes, the time it takes me to fall asleep;</li>
    <li>Privacy invasion: sign up with Facebook, tie an identity to an account. Not for me, thanks;</li>
    <li>Naps? Have you never heard of them? Most apps assume people sleep only once per day. I like my naps, thank you very much. Let me track them as just another sleep during the day;</li>
    <li>I could use the opportunity to do <acronym title="user experience</acronym>UX</acronym> design, which I don't do much of at <a href="http://seevibes.com/">Seevibes</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>App or web site?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I knew iOS offers ways to run web sites with a feel that's to an app experience.</p>
  <p>I also didn't want to pony up money just to track my sleep. Call me a cheap stake.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Open or closed source?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Ah, that decision was quickly taken: open source it is. 3-clause BSD/MIT license it was. Going open source also offered me the reason to start blogging again.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Host myself (Digital Ocean, Vultr, AWS, etc) or PaaS (Heroku, Google App Engine)?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>It had been a long time since I had deployed to Heroku. More than 5 years, in fact. I wanted to see how the Heroku ecosystem had evolved since then. Besides, I maintain servers during my day-job, so I didn't want to have to do that again.</p>
  <p>While I'm testing, I'm fine with Heroku's free dyno that sleeps. Now that I've opened the can of worms and I'm showing the app to other people, I'll pay for a hobby plan, for a month or two. I'll see how that goes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Multi-tenant or single user?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>That was a fun decision! Going single user meant that I would be alone to pay for the app's hosting. If I went multi-tenant, I could have a "product" that other people could use, and maybe even donate. In the end, even if I was the sole user, I chose to go multi-tenant, for the learning experience. Designing for other people is different than designing for oneself only.</p>
  <p>Being multi-tenant did not preclude going single-user: simply hide the instance behind a Basic Auth wall and that's it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Real notion of a user or fully anonymous?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>One of my gripes is the invasion of privacy. I chose to make the app fully anonymous: there are no ways for me (or any admin) to attach an identity to a sleeping pattern.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Server-side or client-side application? Single-page app?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>I like the simplicity of having my data saved to the cloud. That indicated I should have some kind of cloud storage, or a server-side component. In part 2, I will describe more of the decision process I went through on this part.</p>
  <p>In the end, I chose a hybrid solution: the server is responsible for long-term state storage and data aggregation (graphs). The client is responsible for short-term storage: start nap/night, end nap/night. I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage">localStorage</a> to store short-term data.</p>
  <p>I specifically chose <strong>not</strong> to use React, because the library is too large for my end-goal: fast start and rendering on iPhone 4S (I didn't try it, but the minified React JS alone is larger than the JS + CSS I ended up writing; 145 kB vs 56 kB, with 44 kB of that being the minified custom Foundation framework build I used). That is not to say the React model isn't good: I used a stateless view layer in the code, which made rendering and state changes a breeze.</p>

If you want to use the app, please do so! It's available at <a href="http://nofrills-sleep-tracker.herokuapp.com/">http://nofrills-sleep-tracker.herokuapp.com/</a>. Happy sleeping!
