My name is Fran&ccedil;ois Beausoleil, and I live in Sherbrooke, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada.  I was born in 1973, and that makes me more
than 40 years old !

I started coding in the early 80s on an [Adam](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=57), from
Colecovision.  I then upgraded to the "Commodore 64"(http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=98),
diverted through the [Amiga 2000HD](http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=63) (with a 40 MiB HD, no
less !), and then I moved to PCs, and eventually Macs.

In early 2005, I made the plunge, and started my own company:
_International Technological Solutions_. In late 2009, I received an offer from
[Bloom Digital Platforms Inc.](http://bloomdigital.com/), a former customer. In 2011, I moved to
[Seevibes](http://seevibes.com), an Twitter and Facebook data aggregator.
